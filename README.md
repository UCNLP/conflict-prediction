## Future Work

- Research about how chatbot talks to people in various ways.
- Increase the recognition rate of chatbot on human language to make better interaction between users and chatbot.
- Adopt voice recognition technology : Chatbot can recognize the voice input from a user, and chatbot can respond to the voice input with its own voice.
