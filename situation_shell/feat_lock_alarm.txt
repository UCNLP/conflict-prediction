{user2} placed a lock on that file since they are working on it. I’ll let you know when they unlock it.
You can change the file, though, if you so wish, but {user2} is currently working on it (or will shortly).
That file is already locked by {user2}.
{user2} has locked that file. It’s probably best if you don’t edit it until it’s unlocked. I will let you know when.
Oops. {filename} is locked by {user2}. Check with them when they might be done.
