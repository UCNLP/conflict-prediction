You made fewer changes than {user2}. Best to stop editing, and let them know.
You probably should inform {user2} that your changes are smaller than theirs, and maybe pause your work for now.
I feel it would not be a wise choice for you to continue working on this file, but do coordinate with {user2} anyways to see when they are done with their changes.
I recommend you talk to {user2}; your changes are smaller, so maybe you can pause your work for just a bit and let them know.
Your changes are smaller than {user2}â€™s.
