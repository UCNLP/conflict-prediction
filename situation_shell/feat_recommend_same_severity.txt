Your changes are of the same size as {user2}’s ({user2_severity}%). You probably should talk with them on how to proceed.
You may want to coordinate with {user2}; you changed that file the same amount that {user2} did ({user2_severity}%).
{user2}’s changes about as much as you did ({user2_severity}%). You may want to talk with them.
I feel it would be best if you talk with {user2} first, because both of you modified that file the same amount ({user2_severity}%).
You and {user2} both changes that file equally much. Best to chat before proceeding.
