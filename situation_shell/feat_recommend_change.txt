You made more changes than {user2}. It should be ok for you to keep editing, but let them know.
You probably should inform {user2} that your changes are larger than theirs, and talk with them on how to proceed.
I feel it should be ok for you to continue working on this file, but you may want to coordinate with {user2} anyways to see if they can hold off on completing their changes until you are done.
I recommend you talk to {user2}; your changes are larger, so maybe you can convince them to pause their work for just a bit.
{user2}â€™s changes are smaller than yours.
