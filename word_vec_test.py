# 4. ignore_alarm : User can ignore direct and indirect conflict.
# 5. check_conflict : Before user works, user can check if he generates conflict or not with user's working file.
# 6. working_status : User can ask about other user's working status
# 7. channel_message : User can let chatbot give message to channel.
# 8. user_message : User can let chatbot give message to other users.
# 9. recommend : User can ask recommend behavior about conflict.
